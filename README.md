future c64 game, making it rpgmaker-y with PETSCII, like a roguelike. will have lots of talking so may need ram expansion. 

TODO (easiest to hardest):
Doors
Story Branching
Convert Map (current bytes / flags to stuff more useful, would abstract things a lot)
NPCs
Dialogue with Choices
Intro (in progress)
Sprites for Certain Effects (idk anything about sprites right now lol)
