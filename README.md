future c64 game, making it rpgmaker-y with PETSCII, like a roguelike. will have lots of talking so may need ram expansion. 

sort of interpolating and guessing how a game engine works because i have basically no idea. i find a lot of fun in having to figure things out like people had to back in the day, testing things and seeing what works vs just copying someone elses idea. more to learn as well this way.

TODO (easiest to hardest):

Doors

Story Branching

Convert Map (current bytes / flags to stuff more useful, would abstract things a lot)

NPCs

Dialogue with Choices

Intro (in progress)

Sprites for Certain Effects (idk anything about sprites right now lol)
